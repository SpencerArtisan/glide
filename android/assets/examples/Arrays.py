# If you want to store a list of things, you need an array
players = ["erin", "jasper", "peter"]

# Then you can get an item in the list by putting a number in
# square brackets after the array name - 0 is the first item
# This would print 'erin' on the screen
console.log(players[0])

# You can find the length of a list like this
len(players)
